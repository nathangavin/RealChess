RealChess Design Docs

- Nathan Gavin


Premise:

Build a chess game, but replace standard pieces with groups of units inspired from
total war games. Then develop the animations such that the "troops" move more 
realistically between eachother. From that point, modify the rules of the game so
that the interactions between units are more realistic as well.

Process for achieving goal:

build poc just using javascript, just the step of replacing pieces with units.
